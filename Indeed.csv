"Junior Data Analyst","Dobility, Inc. (SurveyCTO)","Dobility’s mission is to provide great technology to improve data collected by research, social, and public sector organizations. Although we are a small, lean, and early-stage social enterprise, our product, SurveyCTO, has already been used by thousands of teams in roughly 150 countries.
We are looking for an energetic and entrepreneurial individual to join our team and turn data collected from all parts of the company into insights that help drive decisions, improve our business, and achieve our social mission.
This position offers the opportunity to be Dobility’s full-time Junior Data Analyst and to play a key role in creating a data-first, continuous-learning culture at the company. You will design experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different business and product ideas and build and maintain data systems that inform the work of our growth, product, and customer success teams. The successful candidate will turn data into information, information into insight, and insight into business decision recommendations.
Responsibilities:
This is a full-time position based in Cambridge, Massachusetts (or our Manchester, New Hampshire office). Particularly for those with longer commutes, flexible office and telecommuting schedules are possible.
About the organization:
Dobility, the company behind SurveyCTO, was founded by Dr. Christopher Robert, an early tech entrepreneur and CTO who left technology to live overseas, train in economics and public policy, then research and teach at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. His experience on the ground made him realize that the research and development sectors badly needed better technology to gather and manage data. Dobility’s mission is to help ensure that high-quality data is affordable, so that more decisions are based on good data (vs. bad data or no data).
Dobility differentiates itself in the market by providing unmatched reliability, affordability, and customer support. It is a fast-moving company with a motivated team that has spent time in the field to understand customers’ pain points first-hand.
About the product:
SurveyCTO is a survey and data-collection platform designed for the specific demands of doing research in developing countries and other challenging settings. It can be used online or offline, on web, tablet, or phone. Most often it’s used by surveyors in the field to perform guided interviews with survey respondents (“Computer Assisted Personal Interviews”). It protects against fraud by recording how long surveys take, audio recording when suspicious behavior is flagged, and employing statistical algorithms to look for anomalies in the data. It’s also an extraordinarily flexible platform that allows for advanced survey logic, pre-loading existing data into survey questions, and automatically merging incoming data into back-office applications like Excel.
SurveyCTO has been used to collect over three million survey submissions in roughly 150 countries by organizations such as the World Bank, Save the Children, Clinton Health Access Initiative, Innovations for Poverty Action, and many others. You can see other examples of organizations we work with on our website.

We are looking for an energetic and entrepreneurial individual to join our team and turn data collected from all parts of the company into insights that help drive decisions, improve our business, and achieve our social mission.
This position offers the opportunity to be Dobility’s full-time Junior Data Analyst and to play a key role in creating a data-first, continuous-learning culture at the company.

About the organization:
Dobility, the company behind SurveyCTO, was founded by Dr. Christopher Robert, an early tech entrepreneur and CTO who left technology to live overseas, train in economics and public policy, then research and teach at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government. His experience on the ground made him realize that the research and development sectors badly needed better technology to gather and manage data. Dobility’s mission is to help ensure that high-quality data is affordable, so that more decisions are based on good data (vs. bad data or no data).
Dobility differentiates itself in the market by providing unmatched reliability, affordability, and customer support. It is a fast-moving company with a motivated team that has spent time in the field to understand customers’ pain points first-hand.
About the product:
SurveyCTO is a survey and data-collection platform designed for the specific demands of doing research in developing countries and other challenging settings. It can be used online or offline, on web, tablet, or phone. Most often it’s used by surveyors in the field to perform guided interviews with survey respondents (“Computer Assisted Personal Interviews”). It protects against fraud by recording how long surveys take, audio recording when suspicious behavior is flagged, and employing statistical algorithms to look for anomalies in the data. It’s also an extraordinarily flexible platform that allows for advanced survey logic, pre-loading existing data into survey questions, and automatically merging incoming data into back-office applications like Excel.
SurveyCTO has been used to collect over three million survey submissions in roughly 150 countries by organizations such as the World Bank, Save the Children, Clinton Health Access Initiative, Innovations for Poverty Action, and many others.

"Marketing Data Analyst","ButcherBox","About the company:
ButcherBox delivers 100% grass-fed beef, organic chicken, and heritage breed pork directly to your door. We are a fast paced, high growth start-up headquartered in Cambridge, MA.
Our founder was first introduced to 100% grass-fed beef through a local farmer who sold ¼ and ½ shares of cattle. After trying it, he was instantly hooked. He preferred the more natural taste and was thrilled to discover the many health advantages grass-fed beef has over ordinary grain-fed beef. So his question became, “why isn’t everyone eating this?”
After doing some research, he discovered that not everyone has access to grass-fed beef, and even if people have access, their selection is often limited to just ground beef. This helps explain why just 1% of the total beef consumed in the United States is 100% grass-fed. While the Company began only offering beef to our customers, we have since expanded to providing organic chicken and heritage breed pork.
We believe in a healthier food system where everyone has access to meat the way Nature intended: free of antibiotics and hormones, and humanely raised on open pasture.
ButcherBox exists to ensure that access to high-quality meat you can trust is easy. We provide better meat for a better you.
Position:
It's an exciting time to join ButcherBox. We have enjoyed a 500% increase in subscriber base YoY and have exciting plans for 2018. We need a Marketing Data Analyst to bring our customer acquisition analysis to new levels and help hit our 2018 growth goals.
